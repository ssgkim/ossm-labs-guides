# Service Mesh Observability Stack
# Red Hat Summit 2023

== Part II:  Development Environment Verification & Observability Usage

[IMPORTANT]
====
Export the following in a terminal in your link:https://codeserver-codeserver-%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%.%OCP_DOMAIN%[code-server environment].

* export CLUSTER_API=%API_URL%
* export LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID=%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%
* export OCP_DOMAIN=%OCP_DOMAIN%
* export SSO_CLIENT_SECRET=bcd06d5bdd1dbaaf81853d10a66aeb989a38dd51
====

=== Task 1: Access the Travel Control Dashboard
* Log in via CLI with user `emma` who has access to `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system` and get the URL to the application business dashboard. Paste the URL in a Browser to verify that you can reach the *Travel Control Dashboard* .

[source, shell]
----
./lab-3/login-as.sh emma
echo "http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n %LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system)"
----

* The result should look like

=== Task 2: Access the Observability Stack

In this task you will learn how you can find the URLs to the Observability Stack components of the Service Mesh.

* Logged in via CLI (we have used user `cristina`/`cristina`) execute the following to retrieve the URLs of the `OSSM` Observability Stack (`Kiali`, `Jaeger`, `Prometheus`, `Grafana`) components. Open the links on a browser and use the preceeding `cristina`'s credentials to login.
+
[source, shell]
----
./lab-3/login-as.sh cristina
echo "http://$(oc get route kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n %LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route jaeger -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n %LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route prometheus -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n %LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system)"
echo "https://$(oc get route grafana -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n %LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system)"
----

* An alternate method to access some of the components is once you have logged into `Kiali` you can access the `Grafana` and `Jaeger` URLs by clicking on *?* next to your name (top-right KIALI corner), then *About* and you should have the URLs presented.

=== Task 3: Test the Observability stack as Product Owner for the Travel Demo Solution

Access the `Kiali` URL (see the CLI output) and login with username/password *`mus`*/*`mus`* (role: `Application Viewer`)

Follow the menu to the left to _Graph_ and as the `Product Owner` you have *view* access to all 3 _data plane_ namespaces and the _control plane_ namespace.

image::02-mus-kiali-view.png[]

You are allowed to:

1. See traces for the overall solution. From the `Kiali` menu on the left go to `Distributed Tracing` and login with your Openshift credentials (`mus/mus`) to view the tracing console (Authorize Access). Finally, select from the Service drop-down list `istio-ingressgateway`.
2. See metrics for the overall solution. Go to `Workloads` in `Kiali` and select `cars-v1` application workload. Use the `inbound` or `outbound` metrics.

+
image::02-mus-kiali-inbound-metrics.png[]

3. *Alternatively*, go to `Prometheus` (URL identified above) and login with your credentials (*`mus`*/*`mus`*). Apply on the `Graph` view ONE of the following metrics:
*** `istio_requests_total{destination_workload="discounts-v1", app="discounts"}` to visualize requests towards `discounts-v1`
*** `istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count{app="discounts"}`
*** `istio_response_bytes_bucket`
4. See the dashboards in grafana for the solution. Access the `Grafana` URL log with credentials *`mus`*/*`mus`* (role: `Application Viewer`, See above on how to find the URL)
*** Check the 'status' of the overall Travel Agency solution *Dashboards -> Manage -> Istio -> Istio Mesh Dashboard*
+
image::02-grafana-istio-mesh-dashboard.png[]

*** Check the 'performance' of the overall Travel Agency solution *Dashboards -> Manage -> Istio -> Istio Performance Dashboard*
+

==== Verifying that RBAC restrictions for the `Product Owner` are in place
[WARNING]
====
As `Product Owner` You are not allowed to modify the Istio Configurations and view the Istio logs
====

* You should not be able to modify configs via `Kiali` as user *`mus`*. If you select in the menu to the left `Istio Config`, select from the top drop-down namespace `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-prod-istio-system`, filter by _Istio Type_ `Gateway` and enter the `control-gateway` config you will notice the config cannot be modified by the user.
+
image::02-mus-view-config.png[]

* In Kiali as *`mus`* you cannot access the logs of any workload, neither for `istio-proxy` nor for the main workload container. In the menu, to the left, go to `Workloads`, click on `cars-v1` workload and then go to tab `logs`, no logs are displayed. Instead, a similar message to the following is displayed:
+
`Failed to fetch workload logs: pods "cars-v1-7b85d9b99b-l4hjg" is forbidden: User "mus" cannot get resource "pods/log" in API group "" in the namespace "userx-dev-travel-agency"`

=== Task 4 (Optional): Test the Observability stack as an App/Domain Owner for the Travel-Portal or Travel-Services Domain

1. Access `Kiali` URL with username/password *`farid`*/*`farid`* (role: `Mesh Developer`)

* As the `Domain Owner` of the _Travel Services_ domain you have *view* access to
** _data plane_ namespace `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-travel-agency` and the
** _control plane_ `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system` namespace.
+
image::02-travel-services-domain.png[]

* You are also allowed to:
2. See traces for the overall solution. From `Kiali` menu, on the left, go to `Distributed Tracing` and login with *`farid`* credentials to view the tracing console (select `istio-ingressgateway.%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system` from the service drop down menu).
+
image::02-jaege-traces.png[]

3. See metrics. Go to `Prometheus` URL (identified above) and login with your credentials. Apply on the `Graph` view the appropriate metrics required (eg. `istio_request_duration_milliseconds_count{app="hotels"}`).
+
image::02-hotels-prometheus-metrics.png[]

4. See logs for the workloads in your domain. In `Kiali`, from the namespaces drop-down list select `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-travel-agency`, in the menu to the left go to `Workloads` and access one of the workloads, the tab `Logs` has both proxy and pod logs available
+
image::02-workloads.png[]
+
5. See and modify Istio Configs for your domain. From the `Kiali` menu, in the left, go to `Istio Config`.
** As *`farid`*/*`farid`* you will be able to see in `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-istio-system` the configs but if you try to modify them you will not be able to as you don't have _write_ access in that namespace.
+
image::02-view-config-but-no-modify.png[]
+
** If you login in `Kiali` as *`cristina`*/*`cristina`* you should be able to access the configs for the control `VirtualService` and `DestinationRule` in `%LAB_PARTICIPANT_ID%-dev-travel-control` and apply some modification as those namespaces are part of your domain (*Warning:* Don't save any changes).

6. Optionally (skip to save time) see Grafana Dashboards (See above on how to find the URL)
*** Check the 'status' of the services and workloads in the `dev-travel-portal` or `dev-travel-agency` by viewing
*** *Dashboards -> Manage-> Istio -> Istio Service Dashboard* dashboard
+
image::02-grafana-cars-istio-service-dashboard.png[]

*** *Dashboards -> Manage-> Istio -> Istio Workloads Dashboard*  dashboards
+
image::02-grafana-cars-workload-outbound-dashboard.png[400,1000]

=== Task 5 (Optional): Test the Observability stack as Developer for the Travel-Portal or Travel-Services Domain

Note: you can skip this section to save time

1. Access `Kiali` URL with username/password *`mia`*/*`mia`* (role: `Application Viewer`)

* As a `Developer` for the _Travel Services_ domain *mia* is interested in viewing functional, performance or configuration issues with the workloads in the `dev-travel-agency`. Therefore, access is given to that service mesh namespace while the _Travel Portal_ domain namespaces and the service mesh control plane namespace are restricted (padlock icon).
+

=== Task 6 (Optional): Test the Observability stack as Mesh Operator

Note: you can skip this section to save time

1. Access `Kiali` URL with username/password *`emma`*/*`emma`* (role: `Mesh Operator`)
* As the `Mesh Operator` you have *full* access to all 3 _data plane_ namespaces and the _control plane_.
** In `Kiali` go to *Graphs -> App Graph*, select from *Display* `Request Distribution`, `Namespace Boxes`, `Traffic Animation`, `Security` and see the Mesh Operator view
** In addition from the `Kiali` menu on the left to go to `Istio Config`. You should be able to access or modify any config as the administrator of this mesh
** You can in addition access logs of the workloads. From the `Kiali` menu on the left go to `Workloads` and access one of the workloads, it has both proxy and pod logs available
** Finally, you can like the previous users access `prometheus`, `jaeger` and `grafana`. On the latter there is a dashboard to visualize the state of the service mesh _control plane_
